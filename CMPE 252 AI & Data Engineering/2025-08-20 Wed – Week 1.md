    - graph, tree, etc
- basic of probability
    - typical distributions, pdf, mean and covariance of random variables
- comfortable programming in at least one of MATLAB, Python, C/C++
    - will be implementing the algorithms discussed in class
    - there will be no coding support

## Tangent class ideas

- Chrome main page extension with GPT integration

## Class Format

- 3-5 homework approx. (2 weeks to finish each homework depending on difficulty level)
- Paper presentation
    - Select from a list, or propose a new one (w/requirements)
- Midterm
    - In-class, closed books
- Final Project
    - Proposal (w/short presentation) + presentations + report

## Grading

Participation/Attendance - 5%

Homework - 20%

Midterm - 30%

Paper Implementation - 15%

Final Project - 30%

- proposal (w/quick presentation) + presentation + implementation + report

## Paper Implementation

- Presentations should convince the audience that you wrote the paper
- Not interested in a copy of the paper!
- Tell us:
    - why the paper is important
    - how it innovated
    - how you think it could be applied or extended
- Again presentations should be ~15 min in length
- Everyone in class will be expected to have read the abstract and introduction of the paper
- Participation in the discussion time after each presentation will be expected throughout the year

## Project

Proposal: 1-2 pages, IEEE Conference format, word or latex, template will be provided

- Please describe what you want to do, what the challenges are, and why they are important
- Important: plan, deliverables.

The project report must be submitted as a paper of 6 pages (standard IEEE conference format) describing the project outcome

- There project requirements will be given.
- The project should ideally be the core of a potential conference paper submission

Presentation - everyone/group will give short/quick proposal presentation

- presentation used a s a guideline to pace your final project.
- Presentations should focus on what you will do
- presentations should be 5-10 minutes
- participation in the discussion is required

Project Implementation

- Final project accompanied by an implementation
- Use the framework of your choice
- Implementation will allow for visuals in the presentation and a deeper understanding of the material
- Implementations and report need to be submitted

## Grading Due Date Policy

- Due date - no penalty
- Up to 1 hour late - 10% penalty
- Up to 24 hours late - 40% penalty
- Beyond 24 hours late - 100% penalty
- All submissions due by 9pm on the due date

# Path Planning/Graph Search

- A* algorithm combines elements of Dijkstra's algorithm and greedy best-first search:
    - Uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost from current node to goal
    - Total cost function f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is actual cost from start to current node and h(n) is estimated cost to goal
    - Maintains an open list (nodes to be evaluated) and closed list (already evaluated nodes)
    - Guarantees optimal path if heuristic is admissible (never overestimates)
    - Widely used in robotics, games, and navigation systems for efficient pathfinding

### Path Planning Definition and Properties

- Definition -
    - Finding a continuous path connecting a system from a start to a goal
- Requirements/Constraints -
    - Safety
    - Collision-free
    - Efficiency, time, and distance
- Applications -
    - Warehouse applications, manufacturing, safety and patrolling, auto-driving, map navigation

### Visibility Graph

- Assume: robot is a point in 2D, obstacles are 2D polygons
- Construct visibility graph:
    - Nodes:
        - Starting point, goal points, vertices of obstacles
    - Edges:
        - Connect all nodes which are visible
        - Include all edges of polynomial obstacles
- For graph based algorithms, e.g., Dijkstra, A*
- Implement any graph search algorithm from start to goal

### Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm

- Algorithm
    - A solution to the single-source shortest path problem in graph theory
    - Works on both directed and undirected graphs. optimal.
- Approach: Greedy
- Input: Weighted graph G=(E,V) and source vertex v $\\in$ V

- When you code it you can put it in a single row rather than in a table format
    - input: graph with edges (could have weights) and vertices
    - output: shortest path

### Implementations and Running Times

- Simplest implementation: store vertices in array or linked list
- The running time is O( |V|^2 + |E| )
- For sparse graphs: very few edges & many nodes, store graph in an adjacency list using a binary heap or priority queue
- The running time is O( (|E| + |V|) log |V| )
