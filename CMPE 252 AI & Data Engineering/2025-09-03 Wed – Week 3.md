# Algorithm Review
## Open and Closed Lists
- Think of open lists as frontiers of expansion
- We start with x<sub>0</sub> and expand neighbors until we reach x<sub>G</sub>
	- A*: expand frontier that our heuristic says will lead to minimum cost path
	- Dijkstra: expand frontier that is closest to x<sub>0</sub>
## A* Pseudocode
- Open list O = {x<sub>0</sub>}, closed list C = {}
- V(x<sub>0</sub>) = 0, V(x<sub>i</sub>) = $\infty$
- repeat until x<sub>G</sub> is in C
