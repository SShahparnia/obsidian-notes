# Algorithm Review
## Open and Closed Lists
- Think of open lists as frontiers of expansion
- We start with x<sub>0</sub> and expand neighbors until we reach x<sub>G</sub>
	- A*: expand frontier that our heuristic says will lead to minimum cost path
	- Dijkstra: expand frontier that is closest to x<sub>0</sub>
