- Follow the input/output convention closely

## Problem 1

Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm to solve for minimum cost paths on a given graph. We will consider only 2D grid graphs in this assignment. The edge costs are the distances between the two vertices. Each vertex can be connected to at most eight of its neighbors (N, NW, W, SW, S, SE, E, NE).

### Files
Please use the link posted on Canvas to download files.

### Input Description
You are given a grid environment. There are two input files corresponding to the given graph:

1. **input.txt**  
   This file has a specific format as given below:
   - The first line gives the total number of vertices, `n`, in the graph.  
   - The second line gives the starting vertex index (indices go from 1 to n).  
   - The third line gives the goal vertex index (indices go from 1 to n).  
   - Starting from the fourth line, we have the edges in the graph specified in the form of an edge list.  
     Each line specifies one edge: `i j wij` which indicates that there is a directed edge from i to j with a cost of `wij`. Note that this is a directed graph.  

2. **coords.txt**  
   This file lists the x and y coordinates of the vertices starting with vertex numbered 1 on the first line.  

### Output Description
You may implement your algorithm using one of the following languages: MATLAB, C/C++, Python, or Java.  

The output file **ID.txt** must have two lines:
- **First line**: List the indices of the vertices on the shortest path (from start to goal).  
  - If multiple options exist with the same cost, choose the path with the smaller index first.  
  - Example: If paths `1 3 2 …` and `1 3 4 …` have the same traveling cost, choose `1 3 2 …`.  

- **Second line**: The traveling cost from the starting vertex to the goal vertex.  

A sample input and output file are given on Canvas.  
For example, the `input.txt` file contains 99 vertices. The `coords.txt` file specifies the actual coordinates of the 99 vertices.

## Submission Description
A sample input and output file are given. The requirements of your submission are as follows:

1. **Video demonstration**  
   - Generate a video showing the result in each step using the provided inputs.  
   - The video must show the constructed graph and paths explored/updated up to the current step.  
   - In the last step, plot the path you select with a different color.  
   - Use code/package/plugin to produce the video (not external hardware).  
   - Your video output should be named **ID.mp4**.  

2. **Source code**  
   - Submit your source code.  
   - Your implementation must produce an executable or script named **ID** that reads `input.txt` and produces `ID.txt` in the same directory.  
   - Follow the input/output conventions exactly.  

3. **Report**  
   - Submit a PDF report named **ID.pdf** describing your implementation.  
   - Include instructions on how to compile and run your code.  

4. **Performance note**  
   - Your code should ideally finish within a few seconds using the provided `input.txt` test case.  
   - If your code cannot generate a result within 3 minutes (using the provided problem size), your submission will be deemed unsuccessful.
