# Operating System Structures
## Operating System Services
- OS provide an env. for execution of programs and services to programs and users
- One set of OS services provides functions for user:
	- UI
		- Varies between CLI, GUI, Batch
	- Program Execution: 
		- System load program into mem and run the program, end execution, either normally or abnormally
	- I/O Operations:
		- Running programs may require I/O, which may involve a file or device
	- File-System manipulation:
		- Programs need to read/write files and directories, create/delete them, search them, list file info, permission mgmt.
	- Communications
		- Processes may exchange info, on same computer or between computers on a network
		- Comms. may be via shared memory or through message passing (packets moved by the OS)
	- Error Detection
		- May occur in CPU and mem. hardware, in I/O devices, in user program
		- Each type of error requires OS to take appropriate action
		- Debugging facilities can greatly enhance the user's and programmers abilities to use the system (efficiently)
	- Resource Allocation
		- multiple users/jobs running concurrently
		- Resource types: CPU cycles, main memory, file storage, I/O devices
	- Accounting:
		- Keep track of which users use resources (amount and type)
	- Protection and Security
		- Protection: involves ensuring all access is controlled to resources
		- Security to system from outsiders requires user authentication, extends to defending external I/O devices from invalid access attempts
## User Operating System Interface - CLI
- CLI (shell): allows direct command entry 
	- implemented in kernel or by systems program
	- Primarily fetches command from user and executes it
	- Sometimes commands built-in, sometimes just names of programs
		- if the latter, adding new features doesn't require shell modification
## User Operating System Interface - GUI
- User-friendly desktop metaphor interface
	- Usually mouse, keyboard, monitor
	- Icons represent files, programs, actions, etc
- Many systems now include both CLI and GUI intera
