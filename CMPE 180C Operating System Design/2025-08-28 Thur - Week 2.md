# Operating System Overview
## Operating System Definition
- No universally accepted definition
- "everything a vendor ships when you order an operating system" is a good approximation
	- but varies wildly
- "The one program running at all times on the computer" is the kernel
- Everything else is either
	- a system program (ships with the operating system), or
		- examples of system programs
			- ls -> list
			- vi/vim -> for editing files
			- change or mkdir -> directory manipulation
	- an application program
## Computer Startup
- bootstrap program (This bootstrap program is put on read only memory, bios, etc) is loaded at power-up or reboot 
	- Typically stored in ROM or EPROM generally known as firmware
		- difference between bootstrap and firmware: 
			- firmware (software that's hard coded into your computer in the ROM (computer chips))
			- bootstrap is usually PART of the firmware
	- Initializes all aspects of the system
	- Loads operating system kernel and starts execution
## Computer System Organization
- Computer-System Operation
	- One or more CPUs, device controllers connect through common bus providing access to shared memory
	- Concurrent execution of CPUs and devices competing for memory cycles
- IO devices and the CPU can execute concurrently
- Each device controller is in charge of a particular device type
## Storage Device Hierarchy
## Caching
- Important principle, performed at many levels in a computer(in hardware, OS, software)
- Information in use copied from slower to faster storage temporarily
- Faster storage (cache), checked first to determine if the info is there
## Direct Memory Access Structure
- Used for high-speed I/O devices able to transmit info at close to memory speeds
## Clustered Systems
- Multiple CPUs connected via network
	- New technology now clusters multicore (multiprocessors)
