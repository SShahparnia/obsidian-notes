# Project Info
## Steps
- Planning: Define Problem, Data
- Execution: Algorithm, Related Work, Execution Plan
- Requirements: Functional and Non-Functional
## Example: Credit Card Fraud Detection
- problem: fraudulent transactions often go unnoticed
- why: traditional systems can't keep up with fraud patterns
- Affected: Banks, merchants, customers
- Impact: Financial loss, reduced trust in digital payments
- Feasability: Anomaly detection with ML models can be implemented as a prototype within one semester
- Data
## Execution: Algorithm, Related work, Execution Plan
- Algorithm/Methodology
- Related Work
- Execution Plan
	- Collect and preprocess data (Week 1-2)
	- train baseline models (Week 3-4)
	- ipmlement advanced ML/DL models
	- Compare performance (AUC, Precision-Recall)
	- Deploy prototype with API or dashboard (Week 8)
